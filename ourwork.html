						Since the year 2000 Consortium Builders has been building 
						award-winning green buildings, educational facilities and many
						architect-designed homes ranging from $400,000 to $5 million.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a keen eye on your budget, we can design and build you a 
						highy liveable home with many benefits including; 
					</p>
				<span>	
					<ul>
						<li> HIGH COMFORT </li>
						<li> LOW ENERGY</li>
						<li> RAPID CONSTRUCTIOM</li>
					</ul>
				</span>
					<p>
						Currently we are building WA's first PassivHaus, a home in
						Cottesioe designed and certified to the world's most exacting
						standards for energy efficiency and internal comfort.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are also building a great value home in Nedlands that has 
						gone from slab level to lock up in only 6 weeks.
					</p>

					<p>
 						Building technology has progressed a long way since the early 
						days of stonewalls, colonial verandahs and dim and draughty
						corridors.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is now possible to design and build a home to make the most
						of our sunshine and ocean breezes, our warm days and cool
						nights. A home that relates well to its surrounding, with an
						abundance of natural light, expectional levels of internal air
						quality and comfort-that needs very little energy to run, and
						that can be build rapidly! 
					</p>
					<p>
						Learn more about our technology <span>here.</span> You may also like to
						take a look at some of previous work <span>here.</span> Thanks, and please
						do not hesitate to get in touch to talk about your new home.
